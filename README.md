# [TaskTrek](https://task-trek-ten.vercel.app/)

TaskTrek is a dynamic and intuitive Kanban board application built using React JS. It allows users to organize and manage tasks efficiently by grouping and sorting tickets based on status, user, or priority. The application is designed to enhance productivity and ensure that tasks are prioritized effectively. It also retains the user's preferences, so they can resume their workflow seamlessly even after a page reload.

## Features

- **Group tickets** by status, user, or priority.
- **Sort tickets** by priority or title.
- Visually appealing and responsive design.
- Save and **restore user preferences** (grouping and sorting) even after page reload.
- **Priority levels**: 
  - Urgent (4)
  - High (3)
  - Medium (2)
  - Low (1)
  - No priority (0)
